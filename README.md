### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on open source Python tools focused on working with climate and weather data
  - [NCAR ESDS](https://github.com/NCAR/esds) 
  - [ecgtools](https://github.com/NCAR/ecgtools)
  - [intake-esm](https://github.com/intake/intake-esm) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning best practices when working with [Xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/), Dask(https://dask.org/), and large volumes of climate data
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [ecgtools](https://github.com/NCAR/ecgtools) and [NCAR ESDS](https://github.com/NCAR/esds)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with documenting more workflows on [NCAR ESDS](https://github.com/NCAR/esds)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about building data catalogs and working with Dask/Xarray
